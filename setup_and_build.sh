# Path to the actual build script. This should be the only manual change
# needed.
BUILD_SCRIPT="/tmp/docker_scratch/build_zol.sh"

# ========================================================================
# This is the primary build script (of two) intended to build ZFS On Linux
# Debian GNU/Linux packages.
#
# It will start a GNUPG Agent, prime the passphrase and then start a
# Docker container and in that run the second, actual, build script.
#
# It is intended (built for) to run from a Jenkins multi-configuration
# project. To avoid hard coded values in the scripts, it require some
# environment variables injected into the build process:
#   * As build parameters:
#     These will be passed on to the build script, and can there for be
#     seen in a 'ps' output!
#     APP		What repository to build (spl, zfs)
#     DIST		What distribution to build for (wheezy, jessie, sid)
#     BRANCH		What base branch to build (master, snapshot)
#   * From the 'Environment Injector' plugin:
#     + As a 'normal' environment variable
#       These will be passed on to the build script, and can there for be
#       seen in a 'ps' output!
#       GITNAME		Full name to use for commits
#       GITEMAIL	Email address to use for commits
#       GPGKEYID	GPG Key ID
#     + As a password environment variable (will be masked).
#       These will NOT be passed on to the build script.
#       GPGCACHEID	GPG Key ID. See gpg-preset-passphrase(1)
#       GPGPASS		GPG Passphrase
# If not running from Jenkins, set this in the environment normaly.
#
# The following optional values can be set:
#   FORCE               Ignore existing build (true, false)
#   NOUPLOAD            Don't run dupload on the changes (set, unset)
#
# The 'WORKSPACE' variable is set by Jenkins for every job and is the path
# to the base build directory (where the GIT project is checked out and
# build), but if it's not set, it will be set in the script to something
# resonable.
#
# Inside the container, the user 'jenkins' is used, so the image(s) must
# have that user with a writable homedirectory. In that homedirectory,
# a 'build' directory must be created. The $WORKSPACE will be mounted
# in ~jenkins/build/src and the artifacts (packages, changes etc) will
# then be created in the ~jenkins/build directory. These will only be
# accessible from inside the container - when the container terminates,
# the artifacts will be lost.
# The build script takes that into account by copying them into the
# 'artifacts' directory (=> $WORKSPACE/artifacts) for archiving by
# Jenkins.
